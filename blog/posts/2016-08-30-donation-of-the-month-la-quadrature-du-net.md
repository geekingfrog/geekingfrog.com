[La Quadrature du Net](https://www.laquadrature.net/) is a French association doing lobbying to protect the internet as a medium for free speech. It is similar to the [EFF](https://www.eff.org/) in the USA.

It frequently does some news coverage about the current laws in the making in France or the EU, trying to raise awareness about the problems such laws would create.

Among other things, it fights for:

* right to encryption, fundamental for privacy
* net neutrality
* drm free software

If I were in France I would probably be more engaged but living abroad, this donation is still better than nothing.
