Lastly I got interested in Ruby, which seems to be efficient and quite easy to learn. For me who is more used to strong typed language like c++ and Java, it's refreshing to see something different.

And in the same time, I was introduce to the <a href="http://projecteuler.net/">project euler</a> which is very nice to learn basic features of a new language. For those who don't know what project euler is (and are too lazy to click the link), it's a collection of mathematical problems to solve with computer. I'm only at the beginning, and they are very basic, but it's still interesting.
