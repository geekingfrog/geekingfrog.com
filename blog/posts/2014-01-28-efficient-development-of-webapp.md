Last week I hosted a meetup about *How to efficiently develop webapp*. The slides [there](http://geekingfrog.com/meetup/).

The basic outline was:

* Os tooling, including how to be comfortable with the command line, managing servers with ssh, some tips about version control and editors.
* Node.js specifics (real quick). Introducing `nodemon` and `node-inspector`, two super useful node modules.
* In the browser, mainly chrome dev tools because that's what I know best. I introduced  sass sourcemap with the workspaces in the dev tools to automatically jumps to right place in the `sass` file. Also a generic presentation of the console api, with some very nice tools like `console.group/console.groupEnd` and `console.time`.


And for next month, with a [friend](http://www.hiddentao.com/) we're hosting [another meetup](http://www.meetup.com/javascript-enthusiasts/events/162274962/) to present the new features coming with EcmaScript 6.
