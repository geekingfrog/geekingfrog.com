##Neovim
This one is a bit special since it's a recurring donation on bountysource. The concept is similar to [patreon](www.patreon.com), one pledge to give a fixed amount of money every month.
This time, it's for [neovim](https://salt.bountysource.com/teams/neovim), a radical fork of my beloved text editor. The team have already been working on this for almost a year and half and is making good progress.
The major feature I'm waiting for is the client/server architecture. With vim, currently, doing a costly task in a plugin freeze the UI. Having client/server would eliminate the issue and allow much more complex integration with other tools.
They also have [much more planned](http://neovim.io/), I hope my donation will help them devoting more time on this project.

5$ per month for at least 6 months for them then ^^
