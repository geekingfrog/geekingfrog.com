I learnt yesterday from a friend how to use the [!bang](https://duckduckgo.com/bang.html) feature of the search engine DuckDuckGo, and it's **amazing**!

I can directly search inside specific sites without having to go on this site first. Since DuckDuckGo is my default search engine, that means typing `!npm express` will directly get me on [the result page](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=express) of the npm website.

* A weird function in Haskel? `!hoogle`.
* Some nice image of a [crepe](https://encrypted.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=crepes&tbs=imgo:1): `!i crepe`.
* Looking for the [overflow bug](https://plus.google.com/+youtube/posts/BUXfdWqu86Q) on gangnam style youtube video: `!yt gangnam style`.
* How to say Chile in French? `!wref Chile`

And so on... Anyone can submit their own, which is why there so many (thousands).
That's an amazing feature for power users!
