I'm rebuilding my website + blog using [servant](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/servant). It's mostly for educational purposes since there exist loads of great solutions for my needs.

Servant is meant to create API from datatypes. It leverage http content negotation mechanism to render a haskell type to the correct representation.

The servant doc is pretty good, but one thing I couldn't find is how to do a custom 404 page. The idea is to use `Raw` to plug a custom WAI application and put it as the last handler of the api. The tricky part is then to construct the response using only warp's primitives.

```haskell
import Network.HTTP.Types (status404)
import Network.Wai (Application, responseLBS)
import Text.Blaze.Renderer.Utf8 (renderMarkup)

type WebsiteAPI =
  -- some servant endpoints
  :<|> Servant.Raw


websiteImplementation =
  -- handler implementation
  :<|> pure custom404


-- A Raw server as simply a Wai Application, which is a synonym for
--  Network.Wai.Request ->
--  (Network.Wai.Response -> IO ResponseReceived) ->
--  ResponseReceived
custom404 :: Application
custom404 _request sendResponse =
  sendResponse $
    responseLBS
      status404
      [("Content-Type", "text/html; charset=UTF-8")]
      (renderMarkup Errors.notFound)
```

Where `Errors.notFound` is a simple view of type `Text.Blaze.Html5.Markup`.
For example:

```haskell
notFound = docTypeHtml $ body $ h1 "not found"
```

This doesn't do correct content negotiation though. In my case it's not an issue. Otherwise a regular servant handler with the possible content type would be better, although I don't know how to do a default content-type.

You can find the actual source code behind this site (as of 2020-11-29) for [the API type](https://github.com/geekingfrog/geekingfrog.com/blob/e95c73e18368bd446b0487b56360a4628b04998c/src/Main.hs#L58-L64), the [server implementation](https://github.com/geekingfrog/geekingfrog.com/blob/e95c73e18368bd446b0487b56360a4628b04998c/src/Main.hs#L69-L76) and the [custom 404 handler](https://github.com/geekingfrog/geekingfrog.com/blob/e95c73e18368bd446b0487b56360a4628b04998c/src/Main.hs#L89-L95).

Special thanks to Jonathan Moreg√•rd for pointing out some errors in a previous version.
