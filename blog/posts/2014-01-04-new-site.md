There is a new website for <a href="http://geekingfrog.com">the geekingfrog</a>. I added some basic static pages to do some basic marketing and put the blog in another domain (blog.geekingfrog.com). This setup will do, at least untill <a href="http://tryghost.org">ghost</a> is out and I switch to nginx.
