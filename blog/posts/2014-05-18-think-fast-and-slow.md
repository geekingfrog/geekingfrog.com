// Notes ici pour introduire le livre et présenter les raccourcis que sont le système 1&2. Plus l'objectif de cet article: personal reminder and resume

The system 2 is the controller, the one who make sure our intuition (the system 1) is indeed correct. The problem is the system 2 is lazy and has poor stamina. This leads to **ego depletion**, where one, after a prolonged usage of his system 2, has no more willpower to use it anymore. In this situation, be very wary of what you do since it's the system 1 which controls your actions.

The system 1 has a extensive influence on our actions, even if one is not aware of it. The **priming** is the effect where a stimulus is made easier and faster when following another one. For example, a study showed that support for increasing school budget was stronger when the voting took place in a school. It's faster to recognize the word *nurse* if it follows the word *doctor* than the word *bread*. This effect is at the origin of numerous errors.

**Cognitive ease**. If something is made easier, it will appear to be true, or more trustworthy. Ask someone to tell you three stories where he was very confident. Then, ask another one to do the same with 10 stories. The second one will find the task more difficult and thus, consider himself as not very confident.

Another powerfull effect of the system 1 is called **what you see is all there is (wysiati)** (covera in french).That means,the absence of something in a story means it doesn't exist and our mind will not try to find it. One tends to believe what is believable, not what is true, and in this case, when a story is convincing enough, one doesn't look for more clue or information anymore. This effect is fundamental and is the root of numerous other effects.


## System 1's characteristics

* Produces impressions and feelings, which, if approved by the system 2, become convictions and attitude.
* Works automatically and is fast. There is no feeling of control.
* Can be programmed by the system 2 to detect some patterns (search).
* Attach to an illusion of truth good feelings and reduce awareness.
* Find or invent reasons.
* Ignore doubts
* Is biased to believe and confirm.
* Focus on existing proofs and ignore what is missing (wysati)
* Represent series with norms and prototypes.
* Substitutes hard questions with easier ones (heuristics)
* Is more sensitive to changes than to states (prospect theory)
* React more strongly to loss than to gain.
* Isolates decisional problems from others to consider them one by one.
