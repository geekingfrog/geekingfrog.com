Last week, I gave a talk at [my local meetup](http://www.meetup.com/javascript-enthusiasts/events/162274962/) about the upcoming standard ECMAScript6. Javascript is definitely starting to look like a decent language, and will have a lot in common with python (destructuring assignment, default parameters and so on).

The most exciting for me is the possibility to implement coroutines using generators and promises. I already blogged about it, but this bear repeating, it will make asynchronous programming much easier.

The talk went smoothly, but I suspect a good 2/3 of the audience did not understant a lot of things, as they were all beginner in javascript. Also kudo to the guys at Mozilla Taiwan to offer us their nice conference room ^^

The slides can be found on [github](https://github.com/hiddentao/es6-slides) or as a pdf on [slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/RameshNair6/es6-next-generation-javascript).
