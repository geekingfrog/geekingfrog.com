Inspired by [these](http://sametmax.com/le-don-du-mois-mozilla/) [posts](http://sametmax.com/le-don-du-mois-python-requests/) I started to donate some money to some software projects. Last month was for Mozilla, this month, it's for **vimperator**.

This [addon](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vimperator/) enable vim-like keybindings on firefox. It's a great project which allow one to almost forego the mouse when browsing the web!

The latest version of firefox (dev-edition and nightly) break the addons, but this should be fixed soon. I've been using it for the past year, 25usd are not that much for the value I get from it.
