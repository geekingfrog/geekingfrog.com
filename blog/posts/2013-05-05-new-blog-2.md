So this is the new blog. **edit** Replaced by ghost **/edit**

This is a toy project to learn ember and foundation and it took me about 3 weeks to build during my free time.
<h3>Ember for a blog ? Are you sure ?</h3>
Yup, this is clearly suboptimal (<a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> would have been much better) but I needed an excuse to learn Ember, because it's super cool ! The backend is still the same old wordpress, with the plugin <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/json-api/">json api</a>, So i didn't have to write a single line of php \o/

Foundation is neat alternative to bootstrap, and it's built for mobile first (waiting for bootstrap 3), so it was pretty easy to build a responsive design. Also I took this chance to learn sass.

All of the code is on <a href="https://github.com/geekingfrog/emberBlog">github</a>. I still have a couple of things to improve but this first version is ready to be put in use ^^ I'll probably post something in a few days about the things I learnt from this, especially, ember's gotcha and the likes.
