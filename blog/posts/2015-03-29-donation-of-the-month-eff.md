This month, it's the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](eff.org) which receive 50$ from me.

They're working on a lot of important issues like [privacy](https://www.eff.org/privacybadger), [free speech](https://www.eff.org/issues/free-speech), [fight against software patent](https://www.eff.org/wp/defend-innovation-how-fix-our-broken-patent-system). And many more.

I believe their work is really important in these times where giant corporations and governments try to get as much power and money as they can, since software and the internet is relatively new.

For what it's worth, I hope they can at least show a different path, better for the common users.
