Ultra quick post to note this software : <a href="http://synergy-foss.org/">synergy</a> is ultra cool !

Multi platform, it allows one to share one keybord and mouse accross multiple computers. Easy to set up and to use, the huge bonus is to be able to copy/paste from one computer to another (not file though).

It's especially super useful if one goes to work with a laptop and wants to use his desktop pc at the same time.
