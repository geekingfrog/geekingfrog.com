I was usually only allowed to watch youtube video at 360p or 480p only until now.

I keep the links for posterity here:

* [youtube full hd](http://hs-157.moe/tout-youtube-en-html5-sous-gnulinux-avec-firefox/) (in french). This wasn't quite enough for me, I still lacked MSE & h.264 on [youtube html5 check](youtube.com/html5)
* [last remaining bits](http://www.ghacks.net/2014/07/25/enable-mse-h2-64-support-youtube-firefox-right-now/), mostly enabled more flags in `about:config`
