#up and running
This has been a long way. Lots of stuff happening in my life (changed job and moved to another place). This site is now powered by [ghost](https://ghost.org/) and running behind nginx.

It's super primitive for the moment but I'll add more stuff soon. Stuff to do:

* I need to become familiar with nginx first.
* Find a way to import the content of my old blog to this one.
* Recreate a full website and integrate this blog there.
* Add syntax highlighting.
