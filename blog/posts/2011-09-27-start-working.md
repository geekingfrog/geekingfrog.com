I have been very busy these last weeks, because I moved to Taipei in Taiwan, and I just started working last monday. I am now a backoffice developper in <a href="http://www.toro-asia.com/">Toro</a>, a small french compagny which is developping a platform and some widgets for NFC enabled smartphones.

I'll probably post some stuff about my work here, as I don't have much time to geek after work anymore, but I prefer to ask my boss first ;)
