[advent of code](http://adventofcode.com/) is a set of 50 problems which ran the 25th days before Christmas 2015.
It was a pretty fun experience and a good one to try out [a few things in haskell](https://github.com/geekingfrog/advent-of-code) too.

It's similar to project euler but less maths are involved, and more "pragmatic" things like doing IO and graph searchs are required.

A few note-worthy points:

* Parsing in haskell is super nice with [Megaparsec](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/megaparsec).
* Building an interpreter (Day 7) or anything with symbolic evaluation is super fun too.
* Conditions on strings involving positions of letters and repeating patterns are a pain! Maybe I hadn't the right approach but overall it was pretty tedious.

If someone wants to have a bit of fun, or try a new programming language I highly recommend trying Advent of Code.
