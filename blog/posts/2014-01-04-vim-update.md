My snipmate plugin broke yesterday and when I headed to github to see what was wrong, I discovered that the plugin was abandoned by their mainteners... They said <a href="https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips">UltiSnips</a> was a good candidate, provided you have vim build with python. So I installed UltiSnips, and it rocks !

One can import his snippets from multiple locations, and extends snippets from other, very useful for, let's say rails where ruby snippets are also used. This also motivated me to put on <a href="https://github.com/geekingfrog/configFiles">my github</a> my snippets and my vimrc.
