I got [these slides](https://speakerdeck.com/addyosmani/javascript-memory-management-masterclass) about advanced memory management in javascript. Very complete and detailed. Lots of explanation about how the V8 GC works and how to use the different dev tools from chrome.

A good read for whoever wants to know more about or track down memory leaks.
