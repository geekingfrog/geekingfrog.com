Here it is. This blog is at last online. This took me much longer than expected because I had to do anything from scratch.

* First, [install and configuring/securing apache](http://www.howtoforge.com/ubuntu_debian_lamp_server) on my server.
* [Install MySQL](http://www.aboutdebian.com/database.htm) and [secure it](http://www.symantec.com/connect/articles/securing-mysql-step-step) a little bit, along with customizing users and permissions.
* <a href="http://www.debian-administration.org/article/228/Setting_up_an_FTP_server_on_Debian">Set up a FTP server</a> using proftpd. Adding user and permissions.

And of course, running into bugs. I also spent a lot of time trying to set up virtual hosts for my apache server, but at this time I have not sign up for a domain name, and apparently with only the IP of the server, it's not possible to have different virtual hosts.

Another feature I installed (but not used yet) is a svn. More about that later.

Now is time for wordpress customization.
