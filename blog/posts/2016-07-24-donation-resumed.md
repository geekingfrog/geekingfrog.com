The recurring donations are back !

Last Friday, I got a notification that a new release for cyanogenmod was available for my phone. The upgrade process was smooth, but I still needed to update the google apps. I tried before to live on android without the gapp but it wasn't working well. The vast majority of apps require the google service or flat out crash at startup.

Advertisement is Really cancerous and I'm happy I can help this project without being involved with ads.
